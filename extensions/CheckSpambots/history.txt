Date: 26-11-2008

	+ Code copied to check_spammers_plain.php and modified (mainly including HTML being removed) to allow an HTML free version for those wanting to have the checks in their own software (e.g. phpBB)

		If an IP is found to be listed in PHP, if using the main UI, you will be given detailed information.
		If using the check_spammers_plain.php script, you will be provided with it's "simple" listing (e.g. 127.x.x.x)

			The 127 address results are;

				Octet #1: 127 - static
				Octet #2: 0-255 - Number of days the IP was last seen
				Octet #3: 0-255 - Threat score
				Octet #4: 0-7 - Visitor Type
